â”€

## Lyriks Overview
Weâ€™re looking for a team of developers that can develop an elegant React.js Music Application. The goal is to fetch as much meaningful music-related data as possible from the APIs and put it into a well-designed web application.
The chosen team of developers has to help develop the applicationâ€™s frontend and API integration functionality. Our team of designers has already created four unique designs: SoundCloud, Spotify, HomePlay, and Auditica. Choose one of the designs and get the final website to look as close to the design as possible.

## Technologies
React.js (Next.js)
APIs:
Use Shazam Core API to gather music data
Use IP Geolocation API to get the userâ€™s location

## Libraries:
You may use any libraries and packages you might need in your code
You may also use any UI kit you prefer (Material UI, Tailwind, Plain CSSâ€¦)
You may use Redux Toolkit to keep the API calls organized

## Functionalities
* Music Player - Users can click on any song, and a music player will appear. The player must include basic controls such as the previous song, the next song, and pause/play buttons. Additional details such as the songâ€™s name, author, volume, repeat, and duration controls are a plus.
* Homepage - Users can choose a genre and get the top songs for that genre
* Explore - Users can select a country and get the top songs for that country
* Music for Specific Country - Show the top songs from the userâ€™s country
* Artists Page - Users can see a list of the most famous artists
* Artist Details Page - Users can see additional information about the artist and their most popular songs.
* Song Details Page -Users can see additional information about the song, such as the songâ€™s music video and lyrics and a list of similar songs.

## Bonus Points
Bonus points for:
Search Functionality - Users can start typing artists or song names, and results based on their search will show up.
Exceptional Design - Make your design stand out; everyone loves a beautiful user interface. Brand it as a real app and stay consistent with the colors, icons, and design.
Additional Features - Have you thought of some possible extra functionalities with APIs mentioned above? Go wild!
Clean Code - Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

## README - 
    
    Have a quality README (with a unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Reference Project
If youâ€™re still having doubts about the project requirements, no worries! Skim through the Build and Deploy a Better Spotify 2.0 for hints. Donâ€™t blindly copy it; implement new functionalities, customize the design and make it your own! ðŸ˜Š
Timeframe, team, and budget
The MVP needs to be ready in one month, which should be more than enough, considering youâ€™ll work in a team of 4-5 people.
Weâ€™ll have weekly reports where you can update us on the process.
